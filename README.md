# Supply-Chain-and-Management-System
Introduction

Supply Chain Management (SCM) is essential for optimizing the flow of goods, information, and finances across the entire supply networkâ€”from raw material suppliers to end consumers. The proposed system enables real-time monitoring and management of supply chain activities such as inventory levels, order processing, shipment tracking, and demand forecasting. By integrating data across the supply chain, the system enhances decision-making, reduces operational inefficiencies, and improves customer satisfaction.

 Objective

* To track and manage inventory levels in real-time across multiple locations.
* To streamline order processing and fulfillment operations.
* To monitor shipments and logistics for timely delivery.
* To analyze historical and real-time data for demand forecasting and supply planning.
* To generate alerts for stockouts, delivery delays, or supply disruptions.
